Sure, I'll do my best to help! Here are my suggestions for the questions you asked:

1. Designing the store: You already have the initial state and the reducers for your store in your code. To complete
   your store, you need to define your actions and action creators. Here are the actions that you might need in your
   store:

    - login: This action is dispatched when the user successfully logs in. It should contain the user's information,
      including the JWT token.
    - logout: This action is dispatched when the user logs out. It should clear the user's information, including the
      JWT token.
    - setLoading: This action is dispatched when the app is loading data from the server. It should set a flag in the
      store to indicate that the app is in a loading state.
    - setError: This action is dispatched when an error occurs while loading data from the server. It should set an
      error message in the store to display to the user.

    Here's an example of how you might define your actions:

    ```ts
    type User = {
    	id: string
    	name: string
    	email: string
    	isAdmin: boolean
    }

    type LoginAction = {
    	type: "login"
    	payload: {
    		user: User
    		token: string
    	}
    }

    type LogoutAction = {
    	type: "logout"
    }

    type SetLoadingAction = {
    	type: "setLoading"
    }

    type SetErrorAction = {
    	type: "setError"
    	payload: {
    		message: string
    	}
    }

    type AuthAction = LoginAction | LogoutAction | SetLoadingAction | SetErrorAction
    ```

    You can then define your action creators like this:

    ```ts
    const login = (user: User, token: string): LoginAction => ({
    	type: "login",
    	payload: {user, token},
    })

    const logout = (): LogoutAction => ({
    	type: "logout",
    })

    const setLoading = (): SetLoadingAction => ({
    	type: "setLoading",
    })

    const setError = (message: string): SetErrorAction => ({
    	type: "setError",
    	payload: {message},
    })
    ```

2. Handling HTTP service in the store reducer: In general, it's better to keep your Redux reducers as pure functions
   that just update the state based on the action that is dispatched. You can handle the HTTP service in your action
   creators, and then dispatch the appropriate actions to update the store.

    For example, your login action creator might look like this:

    ```ts
    import axios from "axios"

    const login = (email: string, password: string) => {
    	return async (dispatch: Dispatch<AuthAction>) => {
    		dispatch(setLoading())

    		try {
    			const response = await axios.post(`${api}/auth/login`, {email, password})
    			const {id, name, isAdmin} = response.data.user
    			const token = response.data.token

    			localStorage.setItem("token", token)
    			dispatch(login({id, name, email, isAdmin}, token))
    		} catch (error) {
    			const message = error.response.data.message
    			dispatch(setError(message))
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

    In this example, the login action creator dispatches the setLoading action to indicate that the app is loading data
    from the server. It then makes a POST request to your login endpoint using Axios. If the request is successful, it
    extracts the user's information and token from the response, and saves the token to local storage. It then dispatches
    the login action with the user's information and

    3. Here's an updated version of the StoreSlice with the action creators for handling user authentication using JWT,
       Axios and Redux:

        ```ts
        import {configureStore, createSlice} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
        import axios from "axios"
        import {api} from "../config.json"

        // Define the shape of the store
        interface StoreState {
        	isAuthenticated: boolean
        	user: {
        		id: string | null
        		isAdmin: boolean | null
        	}
        }

        // Define the initial state of the store
        const initialState: StoreState = {
        	isAuthenticated: false,
        	user: {
        		id: null,
        		isAdmin: null,
        	},
        }

        // Define the StoreSlice
        const StoreSlice = createSlice({
        	name: "store",
        	initialState,
        	reducers: {
        		// Action creator for handling successful authentication
        		authenticateUser: (state, action) => {
        			const {id, isAdmin} = action.payload
        			state.isAuthenticated = true
        			state.user.id = id
        			state.user.isAdmin = isAdmin
        		},
        		// Action creator for handling logout
        		logoutUser: state => {
        			state.isAuthenticated = false
        			state.user.id = null
        			state.user.isAdmin = null
        		},
        	},
        })

        // Export the actions for use in other files
        export const {authenticateUser, logoutUser} = StoreSlice.actions

        // Define the asynchronous action creator for handling user authentication
        export const login = (email: string, password: string) => async (dispatch: any) => {
        	try {
        		const response = await axios.post(api.LOGIN, {email, password})
        		const {id, isAdmin} = response.data
        		// Save the token to local storage
        		localStorage.setItem("token", response.data.token)
        		// Dispatch the successful authentication action
        		dispatch(authenticateUser({id, isAdmin}))
        	} catch (error) {
        		console.log(error)
        	}
        }

        // Define the asynchronous action creator for handling logout
        export const logout = () => async (dispatch: any) => {
        	try {
        		// Clear the token from local storage
        		localStorage.removeItem("token")
        		// Dispatch the logout action
        		dispatch(logoutUser())
        	} catch (error) {
        		console.log(error)
        	}
        }

        // Export the configured store
        export const Store = configureStore({
        	reducer: {
        		store: StoreSlice.reducer,
        	},
        })
        ```

In this updated version, the StoreSlice defines the initial state of the store, which includes a boolean value to track
whether the user is authenticated and an object to store the user's ID and isAdmin status.

The StoreSlice also includes two action creators: authenticateUser and logoutUser. authenticateUser updates the store's
state with the user's ID and isAdmin status, as well as sets the isAuthenticated flag to true. logoutUser resets the
state to the initial state, effectively logging the user out.

In addition to these action creators, the code includes two asynchronous action creators, login and logout. login sends
a request to the server to authenticate the user with the provided email and password. If the server responds with a
successful authentication, the action creator saves the token to local storage and dispatches the authenticateUser
action. logout removes the token from local storage and dispatches the logoutUser action.

Finally, the Store is configured with the StoreSlice.reducer.```
